reduce current, increase voltage, 
lagging inductive +j , leading capacitive -j
add the opposite to compensate
parallel example:
200V
Z1=100+0j
Z2=10+20j
inductive
I1=200<0/100=2A
I2=200<0/10+20j=4-j8 A
S1=VI1*=200<0(2-j0)=400+j0
S2=VI2*=200<0(4+j8)=800+j1600
S=P+jQ=1200+j1600
I=S*/V*=10<-53A
PF=cos(-53)=.6 lagging
need PF=.8
\theta'=arccos(.8)=37
Q'=P tan(\theta')=900
Qc=1600-900=700
S=VI*=|V|^2/Z*
Zc=|V|^2/Sc*=200^2/j700=-j57
C=10^6/(2pi*60*57)=46uF
two loads connevted via inductor, only real power transfer when out of phase

three phase, star first: neutral at center
clockwise
EAn=Ep<0
EBn=Ep<-120
ECn=Ep<120
ccw, B120 C-120
balanced, 120, all the same magnitude (and loads must be the same magnitude and phase as well)
can transmit more power for the same amount of wire

machine: motor, generator, transformer. 
Constant torque produced by three phase machine. Can be self starting
Vab Vbc Vca are line to line coltages
Vab=Van-Vbn=sqrt3*|Vp|<30
always leading 30 when clockwise b-120
line currents: Ia=Van/Zp=|Ip|<-\theta
Ib=|Ip|<-120-\theta
Ic=|Ip|<-240-\theta
line currents are equal to phase currents when balanced

now delta:
kinda swap voltage and current since we switch from parallel to series (or vise versa? phasee and line voltage are now parallel)
no neutral so no Van etc, just Vab etc
currents feed into points of the delta
Ia=sqrt3
transformed versions, same voltage and same current, Zy=Zd/3 (only balanced)

in Y, can connect n or leave it disconnected
when balanced, neutral cancels out to 0
unbalanced, Ia+Ib+Ic=In
remove neutral wire and voltage must shift
now Ia=Ib+Ic=0 again, make this in terms of voltage
(Ea-Eo)/Za+...=0
(max) 33kV generation 750kV transmission 
susceptibility, ability for it to rearrange into a magnet
how many stay after switching off field is retentivity
they always fight eachother, like resistivity and conductivity
air core transformrs can't become saturated
laminated core, normal cores have large eddy currents, waste energy and makes heat, a laminated core has more resistance, less current, less losses
autotransforers, inductor becomes pot, connected, no core
isolation transformers
pad mounted and pole mounted, solid foundation, possible spill catch basin,

DC vs magnetic
current - flux
emf - mmf
current - H field
B flux in core

BH curve of material
new material never exposed to fields, as current increases, field is: flat at start from magnetic inertia, speeds up, curve approaches saturation, because of retentive stuff, curve stays up as current drops back down, eventually negative, stays negative on way back up, 


ideal transformer has 
0 resistance
infinite core permeability u_c
no leakage flux, all in the core and links the windings
core loss is 0

hysteresis loss because BH curve

good real model, T model, add resistors on two horizontal inductors for their resistance, add parallel resistor on vertical inductor for magnetic flux losses. Current downwards is magnetizing current
uses an ideal transformer, secondary winding can be on the secondary side

voltage drop and current are negligable in open circuit, just take care of magnetic losses, dependent on voltage and frequency
% voltage regulation VR=no load V - full load V/full load v *100%
varioable transformer: on line load tap-changing.
not gonna mess with weird D Y connections
YY DD, same ratio holds, no phase shift

autotransformers. Smartly use one winding for both

per unit system. Normalize all variables
pick a single phase system, Volt-Ampere (=S) call it S_B is the base quantity
no units, it's just a ratio. S_pu=S/S_B
S_B remains the same for the whole system, V_B is changed per voltage level. normalizes voltage to 1
only magnitude, no phase affected
three phase: 
pick S_B
pick V_B for each level, voltages are line to line
Calculate base impedance, Z_B=V_B,LL ^2/S_B 3p = V_B,LN^2/S_B 1p
calculate base current I_B 3p= I_B 1p
convert actual values to per unit
