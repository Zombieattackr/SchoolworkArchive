keep track of stars in each row/col with an array
areas are objects stored in vector ars with chars as names, a size, and vectors of vectors of ints, 
	representing vector of rows, vector of column chords
sort the vector of these objects using opor< which compares the size? could be better to leave it as is.
only needs to look at relative chordinates when doing a circle
while looking for position of star, first check if the row is possible, 
if it is, then check if the column is possible, 
if it is, then check surrounding 8 for others
start search for second star where the first one left off, and so on.

//setup
//create array object, use HW5 for refrence of simple class in the same file
