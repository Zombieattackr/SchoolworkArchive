Learning by doing
unrealized gains
consumers don't save enough

policy:
gov pays portion of cost R on each unit S_K, total S_K*R
firm pays remaining (1-S_K)*R
HH receive full r=R-\delta
financed through tax on consumption - sales tax of T_c on each unit C
cost of consumption for HH is (1+T_c)*C
requires that T_C*C=S_K*R*K
gov revenue GR changes with \dot{GR}=tax-pay=T_c*C-S_K*R*K=0

subsidy impacts the LF market:
demand:
\pi=Y_i-(1-S_K)*R*K-w*L_i)
y_i=K_i^\alpha*(K*L_i)^{1-\alpha}
dpi_i/dK_i=0
dy_i/dK_i=(1-S_K)R
\alpha*k_i^{\alpha-1}(K*L_i)^{1-\alpha}=(1-S_K)R
in aggregate
K_i=K
k's cancel
\alpha L^{1-\alpha}=(1-S_K)*R
R=\alpha*L^{1-\alpha}/(1-S_K)

\a=1-S_K

comes from the growth at y=ki^\a*(K*Li)^(1-\a) that firms don't internalize

how much do we have to tax consumption?

LOM \dot K=I-\delta K=Y-C-\delta K
\gamma K=Y/K-C/K-\delta

win-win-win in our model

Input Varieties model
intentional costly R&D investment
startups: can enter the market, needs to get a loan, survives if they innovate successfully
patents: start as perfect and perpetual, full monopoly, becomes a bit more advanced
startups start as small monopolies, imperfect competition
innovations are new inputs (input varieties), improves production technology. diminishing returns? (others exist with output innovation)

agents:
HH, same as before, no population growth, n=0, rent assets, work for wage, supply LF consume/save to max utility
Final goods producers, almost the same, hire labor and intermediate inputs (innovations) to produce final good. These inputs replace capital growth, final goods market if perfectly competitive
R&D, startups, totally new, demand LF, driven by desire to invest in R&D, innovates, patent, monopoly behavior, sell the input to final good producers, monopolistic competition

same HH <-> firms, but now R&D is in the middle. HH gives assets LF to R&D for interest. R&D gives inputs to final firm for money

capital replaced with innovation
Y_i(t)=L_i^(1-a) \sum_j=1^N(t) X_{ij}^a  0<a<1

Xij is amount of jth type of input
N is number of inputs avalible at time
diminishing returns to L and each X

considering a constant N, constant returns to scale. Demand double X and get double Y
doesn't matter what quantity is demanded of other things, marginal product is totally per X
compliments vs substitutes? in this case looks like imperfect substitutes. Take whatever's cheaper, but *each* has diminishing returns, so spread out as much as you can.
even while spending the exact same on tech, you still grow because you can spread out more and more as N grows

X is not accumulated, needs to be used. Not a great assumption, but otherwise time X was made is important and it's a headache

only state variable is N

final goods maximization
max L_i,X_ij pi_i=Y_i-wL_i-\sum_j^N P_j X_ij
price for tech is a given because patent

dY/dL=w=(1-a)(Y/L)
dY/dX=P_j=a(L/X)^(1-a)
demand for each tech is downward sloping, constant price eleasticity of demand -1/(1-a)

R&D firms
entry decision: will I make enough money to pay off the loan? pattent and innovation is guaranteed, but is it worth the interest?
Okay, so what would the optimal price be and what profit comes from that and does that profit cover costs?

monopoly firm review:
basic demand function P=a-bx cost c(x)=c*x
optimal P* or x*
maximize pi= P*x-c*x
(a-bx)x-cx=(a-c)x-bx^2
d/dx=a-c-2bx
x=(a-c)/2b
P*=a-bx*
P*=a-a/2-c/2
P*=a/2-c/2
P*=(a-c)/2
pi(P)=(P-c)P(x)

graph:
P vs x
D: P=a-bx, intercept P at a and x and a/b
MR=a-2bx, same intercept P at a and half intercept x at a/2b
MC: P=c.
MR=MC determines x, then go up to D to get P
top triangle corner is consumer surplus
middle square is profit, producer surplus
bottom square is cost
middle right triangle is Dead Weight Loss

what's the trade off of inefficient monopolies incentivizing R&D and growth

demand from final goods firms is given for monopolies, Xj=L*(a/P)^(1/(1-a))
startup profit max_P=(P-1)X=L(P-1)(a/P)^(1/(1-a))
results in price of P = 1/a. constant markup 1/a over cost
curved downward demand, monopoly

no \delta, so r=R
future profits are discounted at rate r because just get it now and invest
value of innovation v = \int_0^\infty e^{-rt}dt*\pi=\pi/r
firms can enter at upfront cost of \eta (n), free entry assumption
v=\etta is necessary for equilibrium, benefit=cost

LF market:
R=r vs A, rate vs quantity of R&D loans
D=\pi/\eta (if v<eta, D=0. if v>eta, D=\infty)
supply is upward sloping
number of innovations N = A*/\eta, A*=eta N, =cost * speed
r*\eta*dt=\pi*dt+\dot v*dt -> \dot v = 0

HH and Euler are exactly the same
HH max_c(t) \int_0^\infty u(c(t))*e^{-\rho*t} dt
Euler \gamma_c=1/\theta * (r-\rho)
just plug in r
\gamma_c=1/\theta(L/\eta)(1-a)/a *a^{2/(1-a)}-\rho
\gamma y = \gamma c

scale effects
let \gamma m = market equilibrium growth rate
d gm/d gL > 0?
input market P vx X, monopoly behavior downward D, P=1/a > mc=1
L up, Din up, pi up, X up
LF market r=R vs A, supply up (Euler equation), D = r = pi/eta
because pi up, r up, Dlf up, Slf up, A up, \dot N up, \gamma m up, infinite growth.

efficiency?
usually output just goes to consumption and savings/investment
now we have to allocate over time
now goes to consumption C, existing production X, and startup investment \eta\dot N
aggregate resource constraint is Y=L^{1-a}N^{1-a}X^a=C+\eta\dot N+X
social planner:
max w/ c,X  \int_0^\infty u(c)*e^{-\rho t} dt
subject to L^{1-a}N^{1-a}X^a=C+\eta\dot N+X
solves to two optimality conditions and two sources of innefficeincy
X_sp=a^{1/(1-a)}LN
\gamma_sp=1/\theta * (L/\eta * (1-a)/a * a^{1/(1-a)}-\rho)

static (in)efficiency allocation of resourcecs across activities that don't affect time, c and X at each time t  --  for any given R&D spending \eta\dot N, how do you split what remains?
dynamic (in)efficiency allocation of resources that determine time dynamics, allocation for future use. What do we invest in R&D \eta\dot N and what do we use today c+X


static:
each innovation/input use X_j to produce so aggregate is just X=NX_j
X_m=a^{2/(1-a)}LN
social planner gives 
X_m=a^{1/(1-a)}LN

inefficient 2 comes from monopoly Dead Weight Loss
not enough production
X_monopoly produces at D=P=1/a
X_socialPlanner produces at D=MC
X_m < X_sp

dynamic:
Euler equation:
\gamma_sp=1/\theta * (L/\eta * (1-a)/a * a^{2/(1-a)}-\rho)
Social planner:
\gamma_sp=1/\theta * (L/\eta * (1-a)/a * a^{1/(1-a)}-\rho)

same 2 pops up again
\gamma_m<\gamma_sp

LF market,
monopoly A_m is at S=r=\pi/\eta, depends on private return to R&D, same as why static is inefficient. With social planner, consumer is internalized and maximized, no DWL, higher X, higher r=(\hat A+\hat B+\hat C)/\eta, higher A


policy: 
subsidize output
subsidize R&D (lower \eta (cost of R&D))
  grant system
  tax deductions
patents, already assumed as strong as possible, infinite and indefinite, so what if we weaken?
  pattent term? don't want to fuck with it rn
  forced price reduction, much easier to model
    sorta like partial market power because of knockoffs
subsidize purchases of the innovation
  cheaper to buy patents
  subsizide sale of solar pannel tech

subsidize R&D, \eta becomes (1-s)\eta
\eta down
LF market r=1/((1-s)\eta) is up
Investment in R&D A is up
no change to static inefficiency, this only fixes dynamic

weak patents, can't get away with monopoly markup
P down, X up
improved static inefficiency
\pi down, lower demand for LF, r down, A down, 
increased dynamic inefficiency
can't really calculate anything here, so eh, it depends, competing effects

pattents are a necessary evil

subsidize purchase of patents
gov pays s portion 
final goods producers pay (1-s)P
monopoly price remains 1/a
D_in right, \pi up, X up, r up, D_LF up, A up
improves both static and dynamic

    VL(t)=[-129e^{-2.5E3t}sin(9682t)]+[500e^{-2.5E3t}sin(9682t)]

scale effects of IV
\gamma c = 1/\theta, (L/\eta * (1-a)/a * a^{2/(1-a)}-\rho)
with pop growth, growth rate grows over time
L up, demand for inputs up, profits up, demand for LF up, more R&D investment, 
watch growth in N
A doesn't grow with pop of scientists and engineers


research output=research inputs * research productivity
out=growth, factor productivity, life  expectancy,
input=r&d spending, number of researchers, grant money,
out/in=prod
as researches have increased, prod has decreased

case study: real, good data, not general, hard to find

moores law:
clear output, transistors per inch
extremely high growth
input? R&D of all the big firms, ,divided by average wage, gets number of workers
we do have 35% growth, but we also have input increased by 20 times 70to15
issues: 
firm selection, missing early R&D as those companies died off
public funding? has it been falling?
shifting R&D priorities: used to go straight towards increasing transistor counts. when you hit difficulties in improving, you shift resourcecs elsewhere, what's profitable changes over time

agriculture, crop yields:
yields increasing approx linearly, if not faster
input: effective researchers, use USDA
factor increase has increased linearly if not exponentially recently
gov control, subsudies, pay farmers not to grow, price control,
climate change??, would things be dropping without R&D?
crops are improved elsewhere? need less water, resistant to disease? not all R&D goes into yield growth
consumer tastes? people starting to prefer farm to table? Max quality over yields?
regulations, things need to be tested for longer before going into public use?

life expectancy:
output: life year added
input: not looking at R&D of big compamies, R&D goes to quality of life too, fast release Tylenol, captures many things
looked at number of publications, clinical trial grants, instead
years of life saved, huge boom made in the 90's, on the scale of like 13 days
years saved per trial or per publication is dropping over time
input output lag issues, publication to actual time added to life could be insanely long
infant mortality vs life expectancy?
decreasing intensives to research, fucked up profitability lol
cancer avoided? how is it related to death rates and things that cause cancer?
cross country differences, has research left the US
food quality declining?

pick one
discribe
biggest problem






QL model

innovation is now quality improvements, previous innovator gets kicked out when a new firm enters
innovation cost is no longer known and deterministic, pay for a chance at innovation
monopoly pricing is unchanged
v/= pi/r
p(k)=phi(k)*A(k)
chance of innovation = research productivity * invested amount
expected value = pi/(r+p) = \bar pi * q^{k_j a / (1-a)}/(r+p(k)), p(k) in denominator because it's chance of being kicked out
A(k)=p(k)*Ev(k+1)
cost of investment = probability * expected value
phi=(1/phi) * q^{-(k+1)a/(1-a)}, ideas are getting harder to find
r+p(k+1)=\bar pi/phi
r=\bar pi/phi  - p, downward sloping demand to draw!!!
eta was a yes no decision, now it's continuous as you can invest a little
supply of loanable funds \gamma C = 1/theta * (r-rho)
equilibrium \gamma m = 1/theta ....


efficiency and optimality:
X_m=a^{2/(1-a)}LQ, X_sp=a^{1/(1-a)}LQ
Q is an average quality term, produce more better stuff and less bad stuff, but when comparing, assume Q=1 (would be IV)
X_m < X_sp, static inefficiency 
complicated but in general gamma sp /= gamma m, can be < or >, unlike the IV model where gamma sp > gamma m, (not enough innovation), here it can be excessive

excessive example
input market P vs X, P=1/a, MC=1, Demand = downward sloping D_k, 
Monopoly behavior X_m,k at P=1/a=D, social planner X_sp,k at MC=D, easy to see static inefficiency
private return is smaller than social return
we get D_k+1 to the right, X_m,k+1 and X_sp,k+1 are now to the right
returns to R&D? private, larger pi. social, area between the two D curves, it's surplus that's been added.
social return exceed private (underinvestment) when area under is greater than profit box
private return exceed social (overinvestment) for small profits. Old profit box isn't new surplus, it's stolen from the old buisness. Tiny innovation gives almost nothing to society, but new firm steals a whole lot


input market with kth to kth+1
monopoly graph
mc=1
P=1/a
Demand D_k
going to k+1, shifts demand right D_k+1m price remains, quantity grows, profit grows
x_k+1=X_k * q^a/(1-a)
pi_k+1=pi_k * q^a/(1-a)
new firm overtakes old one, absorbs all of the old profit and demand
like IV: compare discounted value of future profits to cost to enter
unlike IV: earns profits until the next innovation arrives

innovation is now uncertian, we assume risk neutrality
p(k)=phi(k)+A(k)
phi(k), ensures p(k) is well defined,
phi(k) can be increasing or decreasing in k, research productivity, should be decreasing according to paper
k is quality. p(k) is probability that new R&D k is better than existing k, p(k) decreases with k
E=pi(k)/(r+p(k))

policy:
weak patents:
forced price cap, or else we get knockoffs, no perfect monopoly
1 < P_weak < P_monopoly = 1/a
input market P vs X
P=1/a, MC=1, demand down=D_k
X starts at D=P=1/a
lf market r=R vs A
downward demand, r=\bar pi/phi - p(A)
upward supply
policy created: lower P, lower pi, X up, static inefficiency improved
lower profits means demand down, r down, A down, growth rate gamma down, dynamic inefficiency indeterminate IDK
likely to improve dynamic innovation: 



R&D subsidies, grants:
gov pays s share of R&D costs, firms pay (1-s) share,


review dynamic vs static inefficiency in OL
return to next innovation
social is added surplus, big gains from big innovations
private return is profits, and beating a competitor steals their profit, so even small innovation gives a pretty big profit 
seen on inputs P vs X graph, price vs quantity of product, monopoly



*the death of innovation, the end of growth*
