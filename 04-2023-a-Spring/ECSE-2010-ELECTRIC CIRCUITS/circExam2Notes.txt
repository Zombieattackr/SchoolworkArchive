circ exam 2 notes

next tuesday

1.1: forst order diffeq
2.1: second order diffeq
2.2: second order laplace


in class
convert V1 into a laplace thing--- V1(t)=10-2u(t), V1(s)=8/s
initial Vc(0+)=10 and I(0+)=0
resistor stays as a resistor 200ohm
inductor becomes positive voltage and a resistor

Vc(s)=10/s+V1(s)((1/(s*e-8))/(200+s*e-4+1/(s*e-8)))
V1(s)

Vc(s)=10/s+(-2/s)((1/(s*e-8))/(200+s*e-4+1/(s*e-8)))
