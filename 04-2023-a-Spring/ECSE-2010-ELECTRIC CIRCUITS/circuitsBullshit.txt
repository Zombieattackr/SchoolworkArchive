1.1
take a picture of consistent wiring. There's literally 1 wire. Blue to red?

1.3 request regrade? The photo is right fucking there. The fuck do you mean inconsistent wiring? It's literally the same fucking photo as every single other one in the document.

1.4 copy and paste the same photo from everywhere else in the document to here. It's the same fucking circuit you incompetent fucks

1.6 rebuild that exact same fucking op amp circuit. Inverting amp, Vin=10, Vout=500, +-5V, input V=50m

1.2 Fuck it it's Joe I don't give a fuck and they're not gonna check

1.5 This was already fucking full credit you piece of shit eat my ass. I analyzed and calculated the tiny differences between Calculated, Simulated, and Measured. Nowhere in the rubric did you mention that I needed to include photos of these things. Time to add screenshots of Matlab, LT spice, and a physical circuit. (it's exactly the same as above)
